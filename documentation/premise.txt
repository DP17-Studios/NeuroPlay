### System Architecture Overview:

| Component            | Technology                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Game Engine          | Unity (C#)                                    |
| Backend API          | Django + Django REST Framework                |
| AI/ML Analysis       | Python (`scikit-learn`, `transformers`, etc.) |
| Database             | PostgreSQL                                    |
| Realtime Comm        | WebSocket / REST API                          |
| Dashboard (optional) | Streamlit / React Frontend                    |
| Deployment           | Docker + AWS/GCP                              |

### User Flow:

1. Player launches game in Unity
2. Unity sends gameplay stats/events to Django server
3. Django stores raw data and calls ML pipeline
4. AI models process data and store analytics
5. User accesses performance analytics via web portal

---

### Next Steps:

* Finalize game design documents (GDD) for each game
* Create Django models and REST endpoints for data logging
* Develop Unity <-> Django communication module
* Build dashboards for players and caregivers
* Integrate AI models and validate with simulated data
