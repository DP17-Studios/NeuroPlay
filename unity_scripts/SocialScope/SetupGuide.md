# SocialScope - Unity Setup Guide

## Creating the Game Scene

1. Create a new scene in Unity (File > New Scene)

   - Office environment
   
2. For each environment:
   - Add appropriate furniture and props

3. Test a scenario:
   - Ensure characters appear correctly
   - Check that dialogue displays properly
   - Test response options
   - Verify feedback system
   - Check social skills meter updates
4. Test webcam integration if enabled
5. Complete a scenario and verify the summary screen

## Building for Desktop

1. Set the build platform to Windows/Mac/Linux
2. Configure Player Settings:
   - Resolution settings
   - Quality settings
   - Input system configuration
3. Build and test the standalone application

## Backend Integration

The game automatically integrates with the Neuroplay backend using the NeuroplaysApiClient.
The following data is sent to the backend:

- Social scenario response choices
- Response time to social cues
- Gaze tracking data (if enabled)
- Social skill category performance metrics
- Engagement level with different scenario types
- Learning progression across social contexts

No additional configuration is needed beyond what's specified in this guide.
